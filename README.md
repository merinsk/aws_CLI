# AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a command line tool that provides an interface for interacting with products and services from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
We can install the AWS CLI on our local machine or a virtual machine such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.
I installed and configured the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI. 
During this project, I established a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance. I configured the installation with an access key that can connect to an AWS account. Finally, I have accomplished the AWS CLI to interact with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
# Objectives
After completing this project, I am able to do the following:
Install and configure the AWS CLI.
Connect the AWS CLI to an AWS account.
Access IAM by using the AWS CLI.
After finishing the project, the architecture will reflect as the following diagram:
