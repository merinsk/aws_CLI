I installed and configured the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI.
During this project, I established a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance. I configured the installation with an access key that can connect to an AWS account. Finally, I have done using the AWS CLI to interact with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

After completing this project, I am able to do the following:
Install and configure the AWS CLI.
Connect the AWS CLI to an AWS account.
Access IAM by using the AWS CLI.
